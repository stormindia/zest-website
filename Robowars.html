            <h2>1. Battle Field</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Interested in designing a bot? Want to test your robotic skills? The challenge is to create a robot (manually controlled / autonomous) whose sole purpose is to immobilize or otherwise move your opponent out of the arena within a stipulated time. This event aims to test your Robot against another in a field of combat where brute strength and cat-like reflexes hold the key to success.</p>
            <h3>Bot Specifications</h3>
            <pre style="height:300px;white-space:pre-wrap;">WEIGHT  AND DIMENSIONS
1. The bot should fit in a box of inner dimensions 600mm x 600mm x 600 mm (l x b x h) at any given point during the match. (Controllers are not included) 
2. The bot should not exceed 35kg and should be more than 10kg of weight including the weight of pneumatic source/tank (Controllers are not included). 
3. All pneumatic/Hydraulic source tanks and batteries should be on the bot itself.
4. The weight of adapters and the remote controller will not be included in this constraint.
CONTROL SPECIFICATIONS
1. The machine can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. 
2. If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of machine should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.
3. If the machine is controlled wirelessly the machine must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of race to avoid frequency interference with opponent team. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for the rematch.
4. The robots are not allowed to cut the opponents control wire. Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification.
MOBILITY
1.  All the robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete.
2. Methods of mobility may include: Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot). Walking (linear actuated legs with no rolling or cam operated motion). Shuffling (rotational cam operated legs)
3. Jumping and hopping, Flying (using aerofoil, helium balloons, ornithocopters, etc.) or any other method of mobility which leads the robot to lose contact with the ground is not allowed.
BATTERY AND POWER
1. The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine is not allowed. On board Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (Such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).
2. Each team must prepare its own power sources. Only 220V volt AC sources will be provided at the arena, but can only be used in the form of DC voltage.
3. The voltage difference between any two points in the robot circuitry (at any point of time in war) should not be more than 36V DC at any point of time.
4. All connections should be made safe to prevent short circuits and battery fires. Any unsafe circuitry may be asked to be replaced; failure to do so will result in disqualification.
5. Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.
6. Change of batteries will not be allowed during the match.
7. It is necessary to keep backup batteries.
WEAPON SYSTEM
Robots can have any kind of magnetic weapons, cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as the weapons with following limitations. Use of pneumatics and Hydraulics are allowed. 
PNEUMATICS AND HYDRAULICS
•	The robot must use non-inflammable and non-corrosive fluids to power pneumatic and hydraulic devices.
•	Maximum pressure in the tank containing pneumatic fluid should not exceed the limit of 10 bars at any point of match and there should be a provision to check the pressure in the tank.
•	All hydraulic liquids are required to be non-corrosive and your device should be leak proof.
•	Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge.
•	You must have a safe way of refilling the system.
•	All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted.
•	Care must be taken while mounting the pressure vessel and armour to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot.

            <h3>Arena</h3>
            <p>The Arena base is made up plywood with dimensions of 14 feet by 14 feet. For protection, the arena will covered from all sides. The arena will contain scoring points that will be announced before the start of match.</p>

            <h3>War Rules</h3>
            <p>•	There will be three rounds, two minutes each with time gap in between.<br /> •	Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified.<br /> •	 In no case should the arena be damaged by any robot.<br /> •	The competition will be played on a Knock-out basis.<br /> •	 Robots cannot win by merely lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow lifting for a maximum of 15 seconds for each lift and then the attacker robot will be instructed to release the opponent.<br /> •	A Robot will be declared ‘KNOCKED-OUT’ if it is unable to travel a distance of 6 inches in 30 seconds.<br /> •	Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage and strategy.<br /> •	If no robot is immobilized within the time limit then winner will be judged on the basis of the points scored.<br /> •	The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.<br /> •	 Violation of any of the above rules or any misconduct will lead to disqualification.<br /> •	 Decision of organizers will be final and binding on all.<br /> •	Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.</p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Each team can have a maximum of 6 participants.  A team may consist of students from different colleges. </li>
                <li>If the organizers doubt the safety of viewers due to a particular bot, then that team might be denied participation.</li>
                <li>The bot is not allowed to leave anything behind during the battle.</li>
                <li>The time measured by the organizers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams.</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>All the combat robots should be operated only after meeting the necessary security clearance . It is advised that the participants operate the bot on their own risk and shall be responsible for any mishaps caused due to their negligence. </blockquote>

            <h2>2. Mazebox</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Do you remember solving path puzzles in your childhood with your pens and choosing different paths till the end? Here is the twist with a little touch of mind game that you gotta do it the same thing but with your ROBOT. Do you think that you can make a robot find it's own path without your help in a maze? Let's see how much your mind works out on the box. </p><p>The students will have to design a code for their BOT so that it can solve any maze puzzle and take an exit on it's own with accuracy, speed and avoiding obstacles.</p>
           <h4> There are two levels under the MAZE BOX:</h4>
            <ol>
