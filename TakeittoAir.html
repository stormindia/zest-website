            <h2>1. Tejas</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>“Jab irada bana liya ucchi uddan ka , phir dekhna fizool hai kad asman ka”<br> 
To design, build and fly a remote controlled electric motor powered aircraft that could take off, fly as specified in the layout of qualification round and land safely. If qualified, teams will have to fly their planes and perform task according to prescribed problem statement. 
</p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Maximum number of members in a team can be 6.</li>
				<li>The participants are required to submit an abstract containing pictures as per the problem statement, before 26TH February, 2017*. </li>
				<li>The participants need to send the abstract and pictures of their model by 26th February* to the undersigned head keeping the subject as “Tejas_Team name_college”. </li>
                <li>The participants are also required to give their details like team name, participants name, college. </li>
                <li>The event will consist of 2 rounds , one is the preliminary round and another is the final round. </li>
				<li>The teams qualifying in the preliminary round will move to the final round. </li>
				<li>The participants are required to bring their complete kits to HBTU, Kanpur.</li>
				<li>A pair of receiver and transmitter (Rx and Tx) will be provided by organizers, on prior request of the participants. The Tx-Rx pair has 6 channels. It can be used to control a maximum of 5 servo motors. Participants who wish to use Rx and Tx provided by us, will have to make provision for this receiver on their aircrafts. The participants can bring their own set of receiver and transmitter if they want. </li>
				<li>All teams must be present before the commencement of the event. Teams will be disqualified if they do not turn up during the slot allotted to them. </li>
				<li>The teams must adhere to the spirit of healthy competition. The teams must not damage the opponent's aircraft in any way. Judges reserve the exclusive rights to disqualify any team indulging in misbehavior. </li>
				<li>The aircraft would be checked for its safety before the commencement of the event and would be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators. </li>
				<li>The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules. Change in any rule, if any, will be highlighted on the website. </li>
				<li>All rounds of Tejas will be held at HBTU, Kanpur during Zest . </li>
				<li>Judges decisions on any matter will be considered final. </li>
            </ol>
			<h4>Aircraft Specification</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>An aircraft (model) is defined as a powered aircraft if it experiences exactly 4 forces during flight, namely lift, drag and weight (due to gravity) and thrust. Note: Parachutes and Para aircrafts do not qualify as aircrafts since they do not have lift. Also airships which contain gases lighter than air are not considered as aircrafts and hence will not be allowed. </li>
			<li>Although there are no constraints on size and weight of the aircraft, it is advisable to keep the wingspan less than 1 meter and weight less than 900 grams. </li>
			<li>The aircraft must lie in a box of 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1.5 m in assembled position. </li>
			<li>The aircraft should be motor powered. Use of IC (Internal combustion) engine is not allowed. </li>
			<li>The voltage of the battery used should not be more than 12V. </li>
			<li>It is advisable to include a good landing gear system in the design and construction phase of your aircraft. Remember, taking-off and landing are very important phases of this competition. </li>
			<li>The participants are free to use any materials of their choice. However the use of Balsa wood, Styrofoam or Sun Board is advisable. Balsa wood is light and easy to handle and to fabricate, hence is a good choice. </li>
			<li>Participating teams are not allowed to use any electronic system that may augment the stability and control of the aircraft, like gyroscopes in an auto-pilot. For the purposes of the competition, no electronic performance enhancement should be used. Remember, the competition is a test of the design, construction and flight performance of your aircraft. </li>
			<li>Participants must make all parts of the aircrafts themselves. Usage of Ready-to-Fly (RTF) and Almost-Ready-to-Fly (ARF) kits are strictly prohibited. However, the kit comprising of unassembled cut-pieces of balsa wood is allowed since it requires skilled work to be done upon it and one can assemble it to his or her advantage. Also use of readymade actuators/motors, remote controls is allowed. Note: Any team violating the above rule will be disqualified immediately.</li>
			
			</ol>
			<h3>Qualification Round:</h3>
			<pre>
			ARENA (Refer to arena layout)

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
The competition provides a platform to compete different launchers using their water rockets through a series of rounds doing different manoeuvres like Bull’s Eye & Goal Post and showing their talent in launching.
</p>
           <h3>Event Structure</h3>
            <h3><b>Round 1: </b>Bull's Eye</h3>
            <pre>
•	There will be an arena having concentric circles with points mentioned in each circle.
•	Each team has to perform their launch into projectile path about any angle according to their convenience at a 50 m distance the arena centre
	from the launch spot.
•	The rocket has to be dropped into the circle to achieve points that is mentioned in the circle. The FIRST FALL position will be considered and
	further collisions to the ground is neglected.
•	Innermost circular region (5m in diameter) will have 50 points.
•	Concentric circular region (10m in diameter) will have 30 points.
•	Outermost circular region (20m in diameter) will have 20 points.
•	In the case rocket falls out of the arena no points will be awarded.
•	Each team will be having three chances of launch.
•	The maximum aggregate in these three rounds will call the winner of this round.


			</pre>
            <h3><b>Round 2: </b>Goal Post</h3>
            <pre>
•	There will be an arena having a Goal post. 
•	Each team has to fire the rocket into the Goal Post.
•	Three chances will be provided to each team.
•	There must be an exact (or near to) projectile path to the goal and the rocket must fall by its tip; otherwise the launch will be neglected without
	points.
•	Team which will projects its rocket near to the centre of the Goal will be awarded extra points.
•	Team with maximum aggregate of points will win up the round.

			</pre>
			<h4>Model Guidelines</h4>
			<pre>
•	Only one model from each team will be allowed to both the rounds.
•	Plastic soft drink bottles of 2.25 litres should be used for the rocket body. Fins are necessary. Other parts should be of plastics for lower
	weight.
•	The launch base structure should be leak proof from all the joints. Bursting of pipes will lead to disqualifications.  
•	The water rocket must use only compressed ambient air as its source of pressure. Maximum pressure allowed is up to 50 psi. Only tap water shall be
	used in the rocket.
•	No chemical, soda or aerated water will be allowed for pressure increase. The amount of water to be filled in the rocket body is left to the choice
	of the team. 
•	Provision for deployment of a small payload with a parachute will fetch bonus points. No component or a body part of the rocket should get detached
	from the main frame during the flight of the rocket except for the case of payload. If any other part gets detached then the rocket will be
	disqualified.

			</pre>
			<h3>Rules:</h3>
			<pre>
•	Eligibility: 
Any student of any academic institution is eligible to participate.
•	Team Structure: 
A team can consist of maximum 4 members. Students from different colleges can also form a team. 
•	Materials and services provided: 
Pressure pump & water will be provided. 
•	No team is allowed to bring their own separate water sources.
But, you are strongly suggested to bring all the materials you require to repair your model. We cannot assure you of the repairing materials.. 
•	NO TEAM IS ALLOWED TO EXCHANGE THEIR MODEL AND LAUNCH BASE FROM OTHER TEAMS.
